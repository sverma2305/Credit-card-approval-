# Credit_Card_Approval_Prediction

## Description

This project aims to predict credit card approval using customer information, a crucial task for banks. Accurate credit assessments reduce the risk of issuing credit cards to unreliable customers. We will utilize customer data, including annual income, employment status, education level, and other attributes, to develop machine learning models for credit card approval prediction. By replacing or complementing traditional credit scoring methods, this project can enhance the bank's decision-making process and potentially improve customer satisfaction.
